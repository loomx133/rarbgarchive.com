I don't ever plan to add ads to it, currently it doesn't cost that much and I plan to keep it up for at least a year, it is running on a server with 1 year prepaid contract.
Special thanks to 2004content for the SQLite backup, without it I won't be able to make this site.

Give it a try and let me know what you think: https://RARBGarchive.com

Will open source it once I'm done cleaning some parts, this whole project was built in 6 hours.
